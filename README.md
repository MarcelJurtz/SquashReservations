# Squash Reservation Manager

This project will be used to manage reservations for squash courts.

Planned features include:

* Registration-free reservations via date, time and name
* Optional spam protection via required confirmation from the provider
* Dynamic amount of courts available

The decision to use provider-side confirmation instead of the user-side, for example via mail has been made due to legal concerns on saving user data.
